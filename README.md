# Project Info

Classification of fraud data, taken from: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/amex-default-prediction
The deadline is August 24th.

ToDo

Build working train dataset

- combine labels
- randomly sample 50,000 users
- compare mean/std.dev of working dataset and real dataset

Build test function (remember how Gini coeffs work!)
Possible techniques: Log Reg (L1/L2 normalisation etc.), Decision tree/random forest, Neural Net, play around with shrinking the data (PCA), try clustering classification (K-means/GMM),trees
